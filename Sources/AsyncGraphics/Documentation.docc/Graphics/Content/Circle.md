# ``AsyncGraphics/Graphic/circle(radius:position:color:backgroundColor:resolution:options:)``

## Overview

A circle can be created with a radius (`radius * 2 == resolution.height`) and a center coordinate (`nil` defaults to centered based on resolution).

![Circle](https://github.com/heestand-xyz/AsyncGraphics-Docs/blob/main/Images/Visuals/Circle.png?raw=true)

In this example the radius is 25% of the resolution height.
